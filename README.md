Installation on Mac:
Open Audio Midi Setup goto Window -> Show Midi Studio
Select IAC driver and enable "Device is online" 
Create a new Port called "Python_MIDI_Out"

Install the mappings in rekordbox for the flx6 and the Python_MIDI_Out (can be selected in the top left of the midi window)
I advise you to make a backup of your previous flx mapping!

Run the python application in the background!
